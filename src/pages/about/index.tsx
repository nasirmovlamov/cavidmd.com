        I'm a digital artist from Baku, Azerbaijan. I'm a CG Artist and Creator. 27 years old and have been in the
        design world for the last 10 years. I learned only graphic design for the first 3 years, then I turned to motion
        design and 3D art to improve myself. I specialize in 3D Arts and my artistic style is influenced by Cyberpunk
        and Sci-Fi cultures.
